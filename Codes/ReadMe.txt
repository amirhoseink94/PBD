All codes for this project are in python and have three-part.
For all parts, you need to fill up the body configuration based on the guide on the top of the file and run the python program.
breaking_version: in this part, we simulate the breaking. You just need to fill up the configuration of your object and let it moves around.
hair_version: in this part, you can fill up your structure that is dangling from a point (point 0), then it will interact with a moving circle in the environment. 
Note that the provided example is a rope.
Main_Version: this is the main version, containing the basic position-based model and interactions.
